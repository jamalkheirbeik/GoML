GoML is an implementation of neural networks in Golang from scratch.

The goal of this project is to learn how neural networks work behind the scenes.

## Quick Start

To build the examples use the following build script

```bash
$ ./build.sh
```

you can then run the executable for example the AND gate

```bash
$ ./build/gates/and
```

or alternatively run directly without building

```bash
$ ./examples/gates/and/and.go
```

Here is an example of what the output would look like for AND gate:
